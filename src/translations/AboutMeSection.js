        bio: "Hi, I am a Double Degree Student pursuing a master's degree in Computer Science for Computer Networks at Télécom SudParis, France and \
        Computer Engineering degree at Universidad Simon Bolivar, Venezuela. I am very interested in Software Engineering. I was fortunate to have had industry \
        experience early on my career. For a year, I worked as a JavaScript FullStack Developer using NodeJS and Angular 9 to build two projects: one that consists of \
        a social network to make bets in certain events, for example soccer. This app allows you to create groups with your friends and make bets for a specific event. \
        The second app was a system to help accountants to manage the company they are in charge of. I am currently forward to delving further into Engineering \
        of bigger and more impactful systems for which I would like for my next projects to allow to learn more about software design, testing, and development tools."
