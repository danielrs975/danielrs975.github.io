    bio: 'Hi, I am a MSc student at Télécom SudParis, France. I am doing an exchange program \
    with this university, my home college is Simón Bolívar University, Venezuela. I am pursuing a Computer Engineering career (Venezuela)\
    with a specialization in Computer Science for Communication Networks (France). I really like my career, I am specially interested\
    in the Software Engineering area. I have some experience in that area, back in Venezuela I worked for a year as a JavaScript FullStack Developer.\
    I was involved in two projects, both of them built with NodeJS and Angular that is why I have some experience with those tools. \
    It was a really fun experience because it let me know a little how is the Software Development world and I liked it. \
    I would like that my next works experiences let me learn more about software design, testing, development tools, among other things.'
